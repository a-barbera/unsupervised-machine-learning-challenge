# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
repository for module 20 unsupervised machine learning challenge for Anna Barbera.

This project is to take raw data, prepare and process it to fit machine learning modules for both PCA and K-means cluster analysis, use these algorithms to explore whether patients can be placed into distinct groups, and share a visualization and findings with stakeholders.
